The 3D Portfolio Project is a dynamic and visually engaging web application designed to showcase skills, creativity, and technical expertise. This project serves as a personal portfolio that leverages modern web technologies to create an interactive and immersive user experience.

In today's competitive digital landscape, a portfolio is not just a platform to display work but also a reflection of one's abilities and innovation. With this project, the objective was to go beyond conventional designs and create a visually compelling interface using advanced animations, scroll-triggered effects, and 3D interactions.

Built using React, this portfolio integrates features like snowfall animation, tilt effects, scroll-triggered reveals, and hover animations to captivate users and maintain seamless interactivity. The project emphasizes responsiveness and cross-device compatibility, ensuring a consistent experience across all screen sizes.

The development process involved a comprehensive understanding of modern web development tools and libraries, including GSAP and React Tilt. This project not only highlights technical proficiency but also demonstrates a keen eye for design and attention to detail.

This report provides a detailed overview of the project's objectives, features, development process, challenges, results, and future scope, showcasing the innovative approach taken to build an impactful 3D portfolio.
